    <h1>Solutions</h1>
    <h2>This page contains our proposed solutions to reduce risks during a typhoon.</h2>
    <p>Giving warnings: Timely and accurate warnings before a typhoon allows people to prepare by securing their homes, stocking up on supplies, and evacuating if necessary. Early warnings also help authorities coordinate emergency response efforts more effectively. These warnings provide information on the typhoon's track, intensity, and potential impacts. By receiving these warnings, people can take necessary precautions to reduce the risks associated with the typhoon.</p>
    <p>Enhancing infrastructure resilience: Upgrading infrastructure to meet higher resilience standards, such as constructing buildings and critical infrastructure that can withstand strong winds and heavy rainfall, reduces the damage and disruption caused by typhoons. Reinforcing building structures, improving drainage systems, and designing infrastructure to resist typhoon impacts can significantly reduce the vulnerability of communities to typhoon-related hazards. Building shelters and evacuation facilities that can withstand storms also ensures that people have safe places to seek refuge during typhoons.</p>
    <p>Reforestation: Planting trees and vegetation acts as natural barriers, reducing the risk of floods and landslides triggered by typhoons. Trees help prevent soil erosion, absorb water, and reduce the volume and speed of floodwaters. When typhoons occur, a healthy forest cover can help regulate water flow and minimize the impact of heavy rainfall. Reforestation efforts also contribute to biodiversity conservation and provide habitats for wildlife, and enhancing the resilience of ecosystems to typhoons.</p>
